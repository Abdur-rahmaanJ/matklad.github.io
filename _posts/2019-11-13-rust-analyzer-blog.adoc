Hey, I've set up a website for rust-analyzer:

https://rust-analyzer.github.io/

It has a blog section, and I plan to post rust-analyzer related articles there.

The first technical article is https://rust-analyzer.github.io/2019/11/13/find-usages.html[Find Usages].

If you are finding rust-analyzer useful in your work, consider talking to management about sponsoring rust-analyzer.
We are specifically seeking sponsorship from companies that use Rust!
