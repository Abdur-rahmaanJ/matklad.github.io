= A Better Shell

I want a better shell.

There are exciting projects to improve data-processing capabilities of shells, like https://github.com/nushell/nushell[nushell].
However, I personally don't use this capability of shell a lot: 90% of commands I enter are simpler than `some cmd | rg pattern`.

I primarily use shell as a way to *use* my system, and it is these interactive capabilities that I find lacking.
So I want something closer in spirit to https://github.com/withoutboats/notty[notty].

== Things I Need

The most commands I type are `cd`, `exa`, `rm`, `+git ...+`, `+cargo ...+`.
I also type `mg`, which launches a GUI version of Emacs with Magit:

These tools make me productive.
Keyboard-only input is fast and "`composable`" (I can press kbd:[up] to see previous commands, I can copy-paste paths, etc).
Colored character-box based presentation is very clear and predictable, I can scan it very quickly.

[NOTE]
====
Take a second to appreciate how Magit interface manages to be both *faster* then command line flags (you don't have to type spaces and dashes) and infinitely mode **discoverable**.
It was Magit who taught me about `--force-with-lease`.

However, there are serious gaps in the UX:

* kbd:[ctrl+c] doesn't work as it works in every other application.
* I launch GUI version of Emacs: the terminal one changes some keybindings, which is confusing to me.
  For example, I have splits inside emacs, and inside my terminal as well, and I just get confused as to which shortcut I should use.
* The output of programs is colored with escaped codes, which are horrible, and not flexible enough.
  When my Rust program panics and prints that it failed in `my_crate::foo::bar` function, I want this to be a hyperlink to the source code of the function.
  I want to `cat` images and PDFs in my terminal (and html, obviously).
* My workflow after I've done a bunch of changes is:
  . type `cargo test` to launch tests
  . type kbd:[ctrl+shift+Enter] to split the terminal
  . type `git status` or `mg` in the split to start making a commit in parallel to testing

The last step is crazy!

Like, `cargo test` is being run by my shell (fish), the split is handled by the terminal emulator (kitty), which launches a fresh instance of fish and arranges the working directory to be saved.

As a user, I don't care about this terminal/terminal emulator/shell split.
I want to launch a program, and just type commands.
Why `cargo test` blocks my input?
Why can't I type `cargo test`, kbd:[Enter], `exa -l`, kbd:[Enter] and have this program to automatically create the split?

[source]
----------
$ cargo test
...
tons of output in progress
...

--- split (healed once `cargo test` finishes)
$ ls
foo.txt
bar.rs

prompt> git ...
----------

Additionally, while `magit` awesome, I want an option to use such interface for **all** my utilities.
Like, for https://xkcd.com/1168/[`tar`]?
And, when I type `cargo test --package`, I really want completion for the set of packages which are available in the current directory.

== New Shell

What I really want is an **extensible application container**, a-la Emacs or Eclipse, but focused for a shell use-case.
It could look like this:

* A GUI application (which draws using raw OpenGL: we won't be using native OS GUI widgets).
* A UI framework for text-based UIs, using magit as a model. kbd:[ctrl+c], kbd:[ctrl+v] and friends should work as expected.
* A tilling frame management, again, like the one in Emacs (and golden-ratio should be default).
* Some concept of process-let, which can occupy a frame.
* A prompt, which is **always** available, and smartly (without blocking, splitting screen if necessary) spawns new processlets.
* An API to let processlets interact with text UI.
* A plugin system for in-process processlets (obviously, plugins should be implemented in WASM).
* A plugin marketplace (versions, dependencies, lockfile, backwards compatibility).
* A plugin system for out-of-process processlets (JSON over stdio?).
* A backwards compatibility wrapper to treat usual Unix utilities as processlets.

== Emacs?

Isn't it Emacs that I am trying to describe?
Well, sort-of.
Emacs is definitely in the same class of "`application containers`", but it has some severe problems, in my opinion:

* Emacs Lisp is far from the best possible language for writing extensions
* Plugin ecosystem is not really dependable
* It doesn't define out-of-process plugin API (things like hyperlinking output)
* Async support is somewhere between non-existent and awkward
* Its main focus is text editing
* Its defaults are not really great (fish shell is a great project to learn from here)
* kbd:[ctrl+c], kbd:[ctrl+v] do not work by default, kbd:[M-x] is not really remappable

== Addendum (2020-03-27)

A "terminals are a mess" story from today.
I wanted "kill other split" shortcut shortcut for my terminal, bound to kbd:[ctrl+k, 1].
Implementing it was easy, as kitty has a nice plugin API.
After that I've realized that I need to remap `kill_line` from kbd:[ctrl+k] to kbd:[ctrl+shift+k], so that it doesn't conflict with the kbd:[ctrl+k, 1] chord.
It took me a while to realize that searching for `kill_line` in kitty is futile -- editing is handled by the shell.
Ok, so it looks like I can just remap the key in fish, by `bind \cK kill_line`, except that, no, kbd:[ctrl] shortcuts do not work with kbd:[Shift] because of some obscure terminal limitation.
So, let's go back to kitty and add a kbd:[ctrl+shift+k] shortcut that sends `^k` to the fish!
