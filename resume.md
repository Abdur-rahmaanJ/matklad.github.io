# Education

* 2014-2016, Masters of Software Engineering (unfinished), 
  *St. Petersburg State University of RAS*.

* 2009-2014, Specialist of Software Engineering, 
  *St. Petersburg State University*.

I have a broad knowledge of mathematics in general (algebra, calculus, logic, optimization)
and computer science specifically (data structures, computabilty, complexity, type theory,
compilers), and I am comfortable with translating academic research ideas into robustly
working code.


# Experience


* **Rust**
  
  I was a member of Cargo and dev-tools teams. I have made [substantial contributions][cargo] to
  Cargo, the Rust package manager, authored one accepted [RFC], and contributed
  [various fixes and features][rust] to the Rust compiler and the standard library.

[RFC]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1685-deprecate-anonymous-parameters.md 
[rust]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits?author=matklad
  

* **JetBrains**

  At JetBrains, I have lead the development of [IntelliJ-Rust][IntelljJ-Rust] plugin for the Rust
  programming language. The plugin is a Rust "compiler" written in Kotlin, with
  full-blown parser, name resolution and type inference algorithms, and
  integrations with build tools and debuggers. Besides solving the technical
  problems, I've created an open source community around the plugin by mentoring
  issues, writing developer documentation and supporting contributors.

* **Stepik.org**

  [Stepik] is a e-learning platform, written in Python, focused on rich variety of
  practical exercises and ease of creating content. I was on the backend team of
  three from the start of the project. Among other things, I've worked on
  exercises subsystem and student's code sandboxing, progress tracking and
  designed and implemented JSON API interface for the single-page frontend.

* **rosalind.info**

  [Rosalind] is a "project Euler" for bioinformatics, with a focus on algorithmic
  coding challenges. My responsibility at Rosalind was implementing master
  solutions, solution checkers and infrastructure around them. The primary
  language was Python, with a fair amount of C++ for the most computationally
  intensive algorithms.

-------

I have an expert knowledge of Rust, Python and Kotlin and successfully used these
languages to deliver impactful products. I have first-hand experience with developing 
production parsers, compiler front-ends and developer tools.

Most of my work is open-source, and I put significant efforts into making projects I 
work on easy and enjoyable to contribute to.
